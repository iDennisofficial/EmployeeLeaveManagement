Leave Management Application

Overview
In todayâ€™s digital age, the process of leave management in educational institutions can be optimized through automation. The Leave Management Application is an Android-based solution designed to streamline the leave application and approval process for faculty members. This application aims to enhance efficiency by automating leave requests and approvals using mobile devices.

 Key Features
- User Registration: Faculty members can register within the application to access its features.
- Leave Application: Users can apply for leaves by specifying dates, type of leave, and reason.
- Approval Workflow: Leave requests are forwarded to the relevant Head of Department (HOD) for approval.
- Various Leave Types: The system supports different types of leave such as study leave, sick leave, annual leave, research leave, and maternity leave.
- Automated Notifications: Users are notified of leave approval or rejection, along with reasons if applicable.
- Leave Tracking: The system automatically deducts approved leaves from the total balance and provides users with information on remaining balance and next eligible leave according to institutional policy.

 Problem Statement
In many institutions, leave management processes rely on manual paperwork, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and delays. The conventional method involves employees submitting leave applications to administrative departments through their Head of Department (HOD). This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and requires extensive paperwork.
